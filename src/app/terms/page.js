                <strong>School data</strong> (names, addresses, curricula, programmes, accreditations, tuition) is compiled from third-party sources including school websites, the International Baccalaureate Organization, and public databases. This data may be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated. Always verify directly with schools before making enrollment or employment decisions.

              <p>
                <strong>Salary data</strong> is crowdsourced from anonymous user submissions. Actual compensation varies significantly based on experience, qualifications, location, negotiation, and contract terms. Salary ranges displayed are approximate and historical.

                <strong>Housing and cost-of-living data</strong> is crowdsourced and approximate. Prices fluctuate based on market conditions, location, and timing. Do not rely solely on this data for financial planning.

  "content": "<h1>It's March and You're Still Without a Job. The Hard Truths About Hiring Season.</h1>\n\n\n<p>January was brutal. You watched schools fill positions at recruitment fairs in London, Dubai, Bangkok. You applied. You interviewed. Nothing stuck. Now it's March and your savings are tightening. You're checking job boards obsessively. The inbox is quiet.</p>\n\n\n<p>Most people don't want to tell you this directly: January was when you should have landed something. March is not plan A anymore. It's plan B. And plan B comes with real constraints you need to understand before you get excited about the few positions still posting [1].</p>\n\n\n<h2>The January Reality You Missed</h2>\n\n\n<p>Most international teacher hiring happens in January. The mega fairs (Search Associates London, ISS recruitment events, Schrole conferences) cluster in January and early February. That's when 1st and 2nd tier schools do most of their recruiting. By March, the schools that have found their teachers have moved on. The ones still hiring in March are doing so because something broke. Either they lost a teacher unexpectedly, or they're lower-tier schools filling gaps. Some regional exceptions exist (South America's secondary season peaks February-March), but globally, January is when the serious hiring happens [1].</p>\n\n\n<p>If you were applying throughout January and didn't land anything, that's information. It doesn't mean you're unhireable. It means you were competing against thousands of teachers at the right time and the schools you targeted chose someone else. Now the competition is smaller but so is the pool of quality positions.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The Visa Timeline Problem Nobody Mentions</h2>\n\n\n<p>Here's what complicates March hiring: visas. International schools know that visa processing takes time. In many countries, it's 4-8 weeks minimum. If a school is hiring in March for an August start, they're already cutting it close. If they're hiring in March for a May or June start, they're in panic mode because visa processing might not finish in time.</p>\n\n\n<p>This creates pressure on you. Schools hiring in March are desperate. They'll make faster decisions, sometimes with incomplete information. They'll offer contracts with tighter deadlines. You'll have days to decide, not weeks. And the pressure cuts both ways: they need you to start fast, which means less time to negotiate benefits or think through whether the school is actually good [2].</p>\n\n\n<p>China, Vietnam, and Thailand have particularly complex visa timelines. Middle Eastern countries vary by emirate or region. If you're applying to schools in visa-heavy countries in March, understand that you're accepting a compressed timeline and higher stress.</p>\n\n\n<h2>What Tier of School Is Actually Still Hiring</h2>\n\n\n<p>Search the job boards right now. Look at what's posted in March. Most of it falls into these categories:</p>\n\n\n<strong>1st/2nd tier schools with specific needs.</strong> A math teacher quit mid-contract. A new campus is opening. A school realized they miscalculated enrollment. These are real schools, but they're the exception. You'll see maybe 5-10 of these globally.\n\n\n<strong>3rd tier schools filling standard gaps.</strong> Smaller schools, newer schools, schools in less competitive locations. More of these are posting. They're hiring because retention is lower and they're always recruiting. Some are fine places to work. Some are problematic [1].\n\n\n<strong>Private language schools, not international schools.</strong> If you're specifically targeting international schools (with IB curriculum, accreditation, etc.), you'll notice the March postings skew toward language centers and tutoring companies. Different work entirely.\n\n\n<strong>Schools with founder/leadership issues.</strong> ISR forums reveal this pattern: schools post jobs because they've lost multiple teachers. Good teachers leave. New teachers arrive in chaos. You can't always tell from a job posting which category a school falls into, but you can ask the right questions [2].\n\n\n<p>The tier matters because it affects salary, benefits, working conditions, and whether promises made during hiring actually stick. Tier 1 schools might offer 40,000 USD plus housing plus flights. Tier 3 might offer 30,000 USD with partial housing help and no flights [1].</p>\n\n\n<h2>The Contract Negotiation Reality</h2>\n\n\n<p>You have more leverage in March than in January. Schools are desperate. But don't confuse leverage with power. Desperation also makes schools cut corners in the contract. They might offer verbal promises (\"We'll discuss a raise in six months\") instead of written ones. They might offer contracts that look fine on the surface but bury problems in the details.</p>\n\n\n<p>Experienced teachers know to ask: Why did the last person leave? How long has this position been open? What's the actual admin structure? Are you replacing someone or expanding? In March, you have slightly more room to ask hard questions because the school needs you. Use it.</p>\n\n\n<p>But be aware: schools desperate enough to hire in March are sometimes desperate for a reason. Low retention. Leadership instability. Financial trouble. Not always, but often enough that you should do your due diligence [2].</p>\n\n\n<h2>Regional Variations Matter More in March</h2>\n\n\n<p>Southern Hemisphere schools (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) run different cycles. They're hiring for January starts around May-June. That's not relevant to you right now.</p>\n\n\n<p>South America (Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Peru) has a secondary hiring peak in February and March. If you're targeting South America, March is actually reasonable timing. You're competing against fewer teachers because most are focused on August starts [1].</p>\n\n\n<p>Southeast Asia hires year-round. But March is not special. Schools are always recruiting. You're competing against teachers constantly looking, not just people in hiring season desperation.</p>\n\n\n<p>East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan) has rolling hiring. March is fine. Some schools have specific start dates (March, April, August). Look for schools wanting those starts specifically.</p>\n\n\n<p>Middle East and Europe: not your market in March. Most positions for August have been filled. May onward is when you'll see emergency postings.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you don't know which region you're targeting, March makes it harder. You're trying to hit a moving target where different regions are at different points in their hiring cycles.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The Real Timeline If You Land Something Now</h2>\n\n\n<p>If you're hired in March for a June start: 10 weeks. That's tight for visas, housing arrangement, flight booking, document apostille. Doable, but stressful.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you're hired in March for an August start: 5 months. Comfortable timeline. This is actually not bad.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you're hired in March for a May start: 6-8 weeks. Visa risk. Only do this if the school is covering emergency visa costs.</p>\n\n\n<p>The timeline matters because it affects whether you can actually pull off the logistics. Schools sometimes post positions for starts that aren't realistic given visa processing. Ask directly: \"When do you need visa documents from me by? Can you guarantee visa processing will be complete by [your start date]?\" If they can't give you a straight answer, that's a red flag [2].</p>\n\n\n<h2>What You Actually Need to Do</h2>\n\n\n<p>Stop applying to everything. Target specific regions where March hiring makes sense (South America, ongoing hiring regions). Research schools thoroughly through ISR forums and teacher Facebook groups before applying. When you apply, customize the application and ask specific questions about why the position is open. If a school can't tell you, move on.</p>\n\n\n<p>Set a deadline for yourself. If you haven't landed something by early April, shift your strategy. May-August is when emergency hiring explodes. Schools lose teachers mid-contract. Vacancies open up. You'll have more options, more time to negotiate, and less visa pressure. It's not ideal, but it's realistic.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you do get an offer in March, take a full day to think through the contract. Read everything. Check the school's reputation. Ask yourself if you'd be okay starting in 6-10 weeks with a compressed timeline. If the answer is no, it's okay to pass and wait for May.</p>\n\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://internationalteachingfamilies.com/2025/09/11/international-school-hiring-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">International School Hiring Calendar: When to Apply</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.internationalschoolsreview.com/v-web/bulletin/bb/viewtopic.php?t=2739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When Does Most Hiring Take Place</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[3] <a href=\"https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/guide-hiring-seasons-application-deadlines-for-teaching-english-abroad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teaching Abroad Hiring Seasons and Application Deadlines Guide</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[4] <a href=\"https://www.teachaway.com/blog/best-time-apply-tefl-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Time of Year to Look for a Teaching Job Abroad</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>About This Article</strong>\n\n<p>Written by School Transparency, with AI assistance (Claude Sonnet 4.5).

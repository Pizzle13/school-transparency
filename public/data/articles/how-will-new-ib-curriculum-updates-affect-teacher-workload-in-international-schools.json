  "content": "<h1>How IB Curriculum Updates Will Affect Teacher Workload In International Schools</h1>\n\n\n<p>Every few years, the IB rolls out a wave of curriculum changes and every few years, teachers quietly lose a month of their lives rewriting unit planners and attending workshops that could've been emails. The 2025-2026 cycle is no different, except this time the changes are hitting multiple programmes simultaneously, and there's a digital exam transition layered on top. If you're teaching IB right now, your workload is about to shift in ways that are worth understanding before September catches you off guard.</p>\n\n\n<p>I've been through three major IB curriculum revisions across different schools, and the pattern is always the same: the IB announces changes with generous timelines, schools compress that timeline into a panic, and teachers end up doing the heavy lifting during evenings and weekends. But knowing what's actually coming (and what isn't) helps you plan instead of react. So here's what's changing, what it means for your day-to-day, and where the real time sinks are hiding.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The PYP Overhaul: New Subject Guides Across The Board</h2>\n\n\n<p>The Primary Years Programme is getting its most significant update in years. The IB released new subject guides across all six PYP areas: Language, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Arts, and Personal, Social & Physical Education [1]. Each guide now follows a unified structure with consistent terminology, which sounds helpful in theory and represents a mountain of rewriting in practice.</p>\n\n\n<p>New transdisciplinary theme descriptors dropped in December 2024, and schools have until September 2027 to fully implement them [1]. That three-year window is generous, and it's the one piece of genuinely good news in this update cycle. Schools can choose to update subjects one at a time, which means your coordinator can (should) spread the workload across academic years rather than demanding everything at once.</p>\n\n\n<p>The introduction of Inquiry Learning Progressions is probably the most substantive change for classroom teachers [1]. These progressions describe how inquiry skills develop from ages 5 through 16, bridging PYP into MYP. In practice, this means rethinking how you plan and assess inquiry. If your school already does inquiry well, the adjustment is manageable. If your school treats inquiry as a box-ticking exercise (and let's be honest, plenty do), this will feel like a bigger shift.</p>\n\n\n<p>Here's what this means for your planning hours: expect to spend 10 to 15 additional hours per subject reviewing new guides and aligning existing units. Multiply that by however many subjects you teach. PYP homeroom teachers who cover four or five subjects are looking at 40 to 75 hours of revision work spread over the transition period. That's not catastrophic if your school spaces it out; it's brutal if they don't.</p>\n\n\n<h2>DP Assessment Changes: Language And Literature Gets Rewritten</h2>\n\n\n<p>For Diploma Programme teachers, the biggest immediate impact hits Language and Literature. Paper 2 assessment criteria have been fundamentally restructured for May 2026 exams, with first teaching from September 2024 [2].</p>\n\n\n<p>The specifics matter here. Paper 2 moves from being marked out of 30 to being marked out of 25, though the overall weighting stays the same [2]. Criterion A (Knowledge, Understanding and Interpretation) drops from 10 marks to 5. Criterion B (Analysis and Evaluation) keeps its 10-mark total but splits into two sub-categories: B1 for analysis and evaluation of textual features (5 marks) and B2 for comparative analysis (5 marks) [2]. Criteria C and D remain unchanged.</p>\n\n\n<p>If you're an English A teacher reading this, you already know what these changes mean: every practice essay you've accumulated, every mark scheme you've annotated, every student-facing rubric you've created needs updating. The assessment philosophy hasn't changed dramatically, but the mechanical process of marking and giving feedback does. And your students who've been preparing under the old system need retraining on how to structure their responses for the new criteria balance.</p>\n\n\n<p>Science subjects are also shifting toward more inquiry-based learning with emphasis on scientific competencies applicable beyond the classroom [3]. The marine science guide has been updated for first assessment 2026, and economics essays may place stronger emphasis on sustainability and digital economies [3]. These are smaller adjustments than the Language and Literature overhaul, but they still mean time spent reading new guides, adjusting lesson plans, and rethinking assessment tasks.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Digital Exams: The Change That Scares Coordinators</h2>\n\n\n<p>Starting May 2026, the IB is piloting digital exams for DP and CP, beginning with English Language and Literature, Spanish Language and Literature, and English B at standard level [4]. More than 60 pioneer schools teaching around 3,000 students will participate in the first round, with the full transition to digital exams planned for the early 2030s [4].</p>\n\n\n<p>For classroom teachers, the immediate workload impact depends on whether your school is a pioneer school. If it is, you're looking at familiarizing yourself with a new exam platform, running practice exams through an online portal, and troubleshooting the inevitable technical glitches that come with any software rollout [4]. The IB has promised practice exams so teachers can \"see how the system works, what the buttons do, how you click through\" [4]. That's reassuring but also represents training time that didn't exist before.</p>\n\n\n<p>For DP coordinators and exam teams, the concern is more acute. As one coordinator noted, the IB needs to \"recognise the immense workload of DP coordinators and examination teams during exam season\" and avoid \"adding unnecessary stress to both staff and students in an already demanding period\" [4]. The logistics of digital exams (device setup, internet reliability, backup protocols, student accommodations) fall squarely on the coordination team, which in many international schools means two or three people managing everything.</p>\n\n\n<p>The IB surveyed member schools and found \"the vast majority\" have the infrastructure for digital exams [4]. That may be true for schools in well-resourced cities. But teachers at smaller international schools, particularly in developing countries, know that \"having the infrastructure\" and \"having infrastructure that works reliably under exam conditions\" are two very different things.</p>\n\n\n<h2>The Workload Nobody Talks About: Internal Assessment</h2>\n\n\n<p>Here's something that gets lost in the conversation about curriculum updates: the single biggest workload item for most IB teachers hasn't changed at all, and that's internal assessment.</p>\n\n\n<p>IA accounts for 20 to 50% of the mark in each subject and is marked entirely by the teacher [5]. For science and math, each student's IA represents 10 to 20 hours of their work, including class time and teacher meetings [5]. Now multiply that by your student numbers. A teacher with 60 DP students across two subjects could easily spend 100+ hours on IA supervision, feedback, and marking in a single assessment cycle.</p>\n\n\n<p>The practical reality is telling. One teacher described receiving 120 draft introductions and resorting to randomly reading 10 in detail, then sharing that feedback with all 120 students, because \"there is no way to read 120 students' in-process IA work\" [5]. That's not laziness; it's survival math. And curriculum updates don't reduce this load. If anything, changes to assessment criteria mean recalibrating your IA feedback and marking against new standards, adding hours to an already overstretched process.</p>\n\n\n<h2>What Research Says About IB Teacher Burnout</h2>\n\n\n<p>The numbers paint a grim picture. Research commissioned by the International Baccalaureate itself confirms that IB educators report higher workload-related stress than peers in non-IB programmes [6]. Nine out of ten teachers say they've experienced burnout, citing heavy workload and lack of support, and two-thirds have considered leaving the profession in the past year [7].</p>\n\n\n<p>International school teachers face compounding pressures that domestic teachers don't: cultural transitions, limited local support networks, and the expectation to master multiple educational frameworks simultaneously [6]. Adding curriculum revisions on top of an already heavy baseline doesn't create a crisis. The crisis was already there. The revisions just make it more visible.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Managing The Transition: What Actually Helps</h2>\n\n\n<p>I'm not going to pretend there's a neat solution here. But having survived multiple IB revision cycles, there are strategies that genuinely reduce the pain.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Push Back On Compressed Timelines</h3>\n\n\n<p>The IB gives schools until September 2027 for PYP changes [1]. If your administration wants everything done by next August, that's a school decision, not an IB requirement. Use the published timelines as leverage. \"The IB's own implementation schedule gives us three years\" is a powerful sentence in a planning meeting.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Protect Your IA Time</h3>\n\n\n<p>Curriculum updates generate visible, meeting-worthy work. IA marking generates invisible, evening-and-weekend work. When your school allocates professional development time for curriculum alignment, advocate for equivalent time blocks dedicated to IA. The curriculum changes will land eventually; your students' IAs have hard deadlines every single year.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Document Everything You Change</h3>\n\n\n<p>When you rewrite a unit planner or update an assessment rubric, save the old version alongside the new one with dated notes explaining what changed and why. Three years from now, when the next revision cycle hits, you'll thank yourself. And when you move to a new school (as international teachers do), having a documented portfolio of IB curriculum transitions makes you genuinely more valuable in interviews.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Talk To Teachers At Pioneer Schools</h3>\n\n\n<p>If your school isn't part of the digital exam pilot, don't spend time worrying about it yet. But do connect with colleagues at pioneer schools through IB educator networks, subject-specific forums, or platforms like ManageBac's community spaces. Their early experiences will tell you far more about realistic preparation needs than any official IB guidance document.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n<p>The curriculum changes aren't optional, but the panic is. Use the IB's own generous timelines, protect your IA hours from being cannibalized by committee work, and remember that every IB teacher on the planet is dealing with the same revision cycle. You're not behind; you're just aware of how much there is to do.</p>\n\n\n<h2>References</h2>\n\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.toddleapp.com/learn/blog-post/2025-pyp-updates-your-guide-to-whats-changing-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your Guide to the 2025 PYP Changes - Toddle Learn</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.leadacademicshk.com/blog/ib-english-a-paper-2-2026-essential-guide-to-new-assessment-criteria\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IB English A Paper 2 2026: Essential Guide to New Assessment Criteria - Lead Academics</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[3] <a href=\"https://www.revisiondojo.com/blog/adapting-to-new-ib-curriculum-changes-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adapting to New IB Curriculum Changes in 2025 - RevisionDojo</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[4] <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/magazine/analysis/specialist-sector/ib-plans-digital-exams-diploma-programme-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IB Plans Digital Exams for Diploma Programme from 2026 - TES</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[5] <a href=\"https://education.ibinnovators.com/ib-internal-assessment-a-comprehensive-guide-to-understanding-the-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IB Internal Assessment: A Comprehensive Guide - IB Innovators</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[6] <a href=\"https://clairedigited.medium.com/addressing-teacher-burnout-in-international-schools-an-integrated-approach-informed-by-b2a7de290ce4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Addressing Teacher Burnout in International Schools - Claire Guillon</a></p>\n\n\n<p>[7] <a href=\"https://www.pearson.com/international-schools/international-schools-blog/2026/01/how-professional-coaching-can-prevent-teacher-burnout.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Professional Coaching Can Prevent Teacher Burnout - Pearson</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<strong>About This Article</strong>\n\n<p>Written by School Transparency, with AI assistance (Claude Sonnet 4.5).
